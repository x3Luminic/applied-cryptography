# applied-cryptography

In my course of study in Singapore Institute of Technology, I had the opportunity to learn and understand how cryptography is applied in the real world.

1. Unilateral Protocol
2. Cisco devices password hashes
3. Authentication
4. Autenticated Key Establishment
5. Kerberos v5 (RFC 4120)
6. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DH-KE)
7. Password-Based AKE (PAKE)
8. Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE)
9. Secure Remote Password (SRP)

Goal of this is to understand how the server and client interacts with each other through such protocols and to implement them.
